## The famous snake game made in python using turtle graphics

### About game:
####                 The snake will grow in size whenever it eats food and
####                 you have to make sure the snake doesnt touch the boundary or its tail
####                 otherwise it is game over.

### Controls:
#### Up: For moving the snake up
#### Down: For moving the snake down

#### Left: For moving the snake left

### About code:
#### I have used 4 files for this game:
##### main.py: All functions of the different classes are called here, it is the brain of this game.
##### snake.py: It contains the Snake class: which is responsible for the snake behaviour in the game
##### food.py: It contains the Food class: which makes sure the food is generated at a random location on the screen
##### scoreboard.py: It maintains the scoreboard. You gain a score whenever the snake its the food
